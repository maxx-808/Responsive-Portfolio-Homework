# homework 3: A Responsive Portfolio
    This is my website portfolio for homework. When finishing this assignment, something happened and my responsiveness failed completely, A TA helped me and could not find the root of the problem because it all seemed good, I did not knowingly touch anything between it working and not so maybe I could of deleted or added a letter somewhere breaking the whole page responsiveness, so I had to redo the whole assginment in a few hours as it happened at 12 last night and I had class this morning and I have work as well. I hope this meets the requirements as I had to do a bit of a rush.
